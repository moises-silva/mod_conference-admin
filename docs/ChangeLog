	libsofiasip: set minimum initital sip t1 timer to 1000ms to work around race condition on retry timer firing before all the things that are supposed to be handled by the timer are set.  The base resolution on this timer is 500ms, so doubling up makes sure we always hit the initial retry timer on the next run, where everything should be set.  The side effect was, 1/2 the time on a request that did not get immediate response, the timer would be fired and cleared, but the action (sending retry) was never done, and a new timer was not set, causing the request to just sit zombied and never retry.  A better solution would be to find and correct the race condition so the timer is never set to early and we never hit this condition. (r:20c2740c)

	libspandsp: Changes to the signaling tone detector to detect concurrent 2400Hz + 2600Hz tones. This passes voice immunity and other key tests, but it bounces a bit when transitions like 2400 -> 2400+2600 -> 2600 occur. Transitions between tone off and tone on are clean. (r:bc13e944)

	libspandsp: Changed T.38 terminal handling, so errors from the user's packet transmit routine properly filter up the chain, cause termination of the FAX session, and are reported to the caller. (r:c890fbfa)
	libspandsp: Numerous little changes to spandsp that haven't been pushed to Freeswitch for a while. The only big changes are a majorly rewritten V.42 and V.42bis which are now basically functional. (r:d30e82e2)

	mod_callcenter: Initial commit of the mod_callcenter application. This module is in it early state of developpement.  You can see documentation on the wiki at : <a href="http://wiki.freeswitch.org/wiki/Mod_callcenter">http://wiki.freeswitch.org/wiki/Mod_callcenter</a> For support/comments, please use <a href="http://jira.freeswitch.org/">http://jira.freeswitch.org/</a> and select the MOD CALLCENTER module. (r:ba09b96d)
	mod_callcenter: Add ability to unload/reload/load a queue setting (You still need to reloadxml before). Note that joining a queue will check for it in the config and load it on the fly... I've used the same system as in mod_voicemail.  Not sure if we should allow this, but just comment it out of the config before unload and it wont be available anymore (r:3eafca60)
	mod_callcenter: Try to fix the ring-all, also add cli auto complete done in previous commit (r:1666783c)
	mod_callcenter: Add missing odbc db support (Not tested, please someone test this) (r:42436e27)
	mod_callcenter: More ODBC changes.  It is not a global settings value.  Cannot be changed in runtime. (r:6980305f)
	mod_callcenter: Added value busy_delay_time and reject_delay_time so we can wait if those 2 occur (Un registred phone are considered as busy). Add a ready_time epoch time when we can contact an again again, fix ring-all (good this time I hope). (r:8082aa98)
	mod_callcenter: Add tiers rules before jumping to a different level.  Also added support for dial-in agent. (r:86c9bed7)
	mod_callcenter: Default the level to 0 since the new tier system will wait x second at level 1... just level 0 that will ring agent right away (if set to do so) (r:6558276a)
	mod_callcenter: You can now allow caller that have hangup before agent answer to call back and resume their previous position. (r:ab2529d4)
	mod_callcenter: correct multiple little things following the recent tiers and join back features (r:9b33bd1c)
	mod_callcenter: Add more channel variable and event and fix a mem leak (r:2d3d8c8d)
	mod_callcenter: Make more sence to bridge the caller to the agent.  Before, in the xml_cdr you saw it it like the agent initiated the call to the member (r:0be95658)
	mod_callcenter: Added max-wait-time and max-wait-time-with-no-agent param to a queue. (r:3482f95e)
	mod_callcenter: Make sure we fail to load if config is not present (r:e1fb79a1)
	mod_callcenter: Fix invalid update of agent field (r:426a448f/FS-2738)
	mod_callcenter: Allow to get queue info via api (r:70d592ae)
	mod_callcenter: Fix bad return type so it compile on archlinux, thx bougyman (r:3a475986)
	mod_callcenter: Make callcenter_config agent get return the value of the item requested.  Also added queue param max-wait-time-with-no-agent-time-reached: If the max-wai-time-with-no-agent is already reached for the queue, then new caller can wait for x amount of second before it kicked out of the queue rather than get rejected automatically. (r:81a03869)
	mod_callcenter: Add new event socket agent-offering.  Plus some documentation and better handling of bad agent type -- FS-2869 (r:80174cf3/FS-2869)
	mod_callcenter: Add error response for queue load and queue reload (FS-2988) (r:49a5effc/FS-2988)
	mod_callcenter: IMPORTANT UPDATE, DTMF during moh created an loop to reactivate MOH but got canceled right away because of pending DTMF in the queue never been cleaned.  Could cause masive disk write of debug, and can cause problem to the rest of FS stability.  This patch also include basic fundation for DTMF capture support for member waiting. (r:cd1982ce)
	mod_callcenter: force loopback_bowout=false on originate.  This will need to be reworked, but should fix basic issues call to an agent using loopback (r:2e399b0b)
	mod_callcenter: segfault using busy-delay-time parameter (r:c6f044d5/FS-3067)
	mod_callcenter: Fix a bug when an caller leave the queue from a BREAK Call (Transfer...), it doesn't think an agent answered. (r:51a531aa)
	mod_callcenter: Add new CLI cmd and change some to be more standard.  Patch from Francois Delawarde, thanks. (r:30dd1774)
	mod_callcenter: >WARNING, some event value got removed< Adding new event time value that can then be used to calculate the Wait;Talk;Total duration of a member were on call.  CC-Wait-Time CC-Talk-Time and CC-Total-Time are no longer returned.  Visit the code or check the wiki for the updated variable. (r:5f233785)
	mod_callcenter: Add better support when agent doesn't answer, including creating a new variable for the delay that is different than reject or busy.  Thanks to Francois Delawarde (r:26303c5c)
	mod_callcenter: Add better handle of failed agent, member channel getting a break, and debuging info upon leaving.  Thanks to Fran?ois Delawarde (with some changes) (r:25cee255)
	mod_callcenter: New Agent order Possibility: Agent order by Level and Position by agents.last_offered_call. Change the default and sequentially-by-agent-order strategy to include the longest-idle-agent.  This should offer a default consistant way to go through all the agent within the same tier/position. (Before, it was left to the DB to return the order of the result) (r:dcafff20/FS-3158)
	mod_callcenter: Generate per member uuid different from the member session uuid.  Might fix transfer between queue.  More changes are coming (r:b63a72f8)
	mod_callcenter: Remove the concept of Caller for Members.  Event Socket event have been changed (CC-Caller.* to CC-Member.*)  Also CC-Caller-UUID is renamed to CC-Member-Session-UUID. The reason for this is you could actually put people to be call in the queue.  So they are not caller per say.  But they are a member of a queue. (r:40a134bd)
	mod_callcenter: Reload a queue wont delete all the currently waiting members.  Only a reload of the module will. (r:c5ae5de0/FS-3250)
	mod_callcenter: Add a very prototype (and maybe not functional) strategy called : sequentially-by-next-agent-order.
